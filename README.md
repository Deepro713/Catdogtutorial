# Catdogtutorial
This project is a copy of the project in the following link: https://github.com/balajisrinivas/Cats-Vs-Dogs-Prediction and does not belong to me. I have used this project to start learning how to make ML projects. The video tutorial is available in the following link- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLf5qmSOkwU

Just feeling motivated enough to work a little for my career. Got bills to pay :3　働きはちょうめんどくさいです。
